Recorder
==========

Recorder is a tool/sample you can use to record all the SensorCore SDK sensor 
data to be used with the simulator classes in Windows Phone 8.1 which supports 
Motion data. Application has indicator for sensors that it is currently recording, 
showing also the lenght of the recording and start/stop/save buttons for each 
sensor separately.


1. Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learn about the Lumia SensorCore SDK from the Lumia Developer's Library. The
example requires the Lumia SensorCore SDK's NuGet package but will retrieve it
automatically (if missing) on first build.

To build the application you need to have Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone SDK 8.1
installed.

Using the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK:

1. Open the SLN file: File > Open Project, select the file `sensemaking.sln`
2. Remove the "AnyCPU" configuration (not supported by the Lumia SensorCore SDK)
or simply select ARM
3. Select the target 'Device'.
4. Press F5 to build the project and run it on the device.

Please see the official documentation for
deploying and testing applications on Windows Phone devices:

2. Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Important files and classes:**

The core of this app's implementation is in MainPage.xaml.cs where the recording is 
handled. The state of the each recording is preserved in Recording class which is
implemented in Recording.cs. Please note that each part of the SDK has it's own 
recorder and requires it's own initialising. 

The API is called through the CallSensorcoreApiAsync() helper function, which helps
handling the typical errors, like required features being disabled in the system
settings.

**Required capabilities:**

The SensorSore SDK (via its NuGet package) automatically inserts in the manifest
file the capabilities required for it to work:

    <DeviceCapability Name="location" />
    <m2:DeviceCapability Name="humaninterfacedevice">
      <m2:Device Id="vidpid:0421 0716">
        <m2:Function Type="usage:ffaa 0001" />
        <m2:Function Type="usage:ffee 0001" />
        <m2:Function Type="usage:ffee 0002" />
        <m2:Function Type="usage:ffee 0003" />
        <m2:Function Type="usage:ffee 0004" />
      </m2:Device>
    </m2:DeviceCapability>
